                    Zebras (US: /ˈziːbrəz/, UK: /ˈzɛbrəz, ˈziː-/)[2] (subgenus Hippotigris) are African equines with
                    distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three living species: Grévy's zebra (Equus
                    grevyi), the plains zebra (E. quagga), and the mountain zebra (E. zebra). Zebras share the genus
                    Equus with horses and asses, the three groups being the only living members of the family Equidae.
                    Zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. Several theories have been
                    proposed for the function of these patterns, with most evidence supporting them as a deterrent for
                    biting flies. Zebras inhabit eastern and southern Africa and can be found in a variety of habitats
                    such as savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, shrublands, and mountainous areas.
